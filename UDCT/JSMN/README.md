## Spec tests implemented:
- Feed urls and names are defined and not empty
- The feed selection menu is hidden at startup and his visibility is correctly toggled.
- loadFeed function loads at least one article entry
- Feeds are correctly changed by loadFeed function

## How to run
Clone the repository and open index.html. 
All spec tests are defined in jasmine/spec/feedreader.js. All tests should pass by default.
Additional tests can be added in jasmine/spec/feedreader.js.
