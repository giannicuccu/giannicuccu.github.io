# Memory Game Project

## Overview

My implementation of the Memory Game Project for Udacity Nanodegree program


## Notes

In this version the game should be completed in 90 seconds, 
you can change the game duration by setting different value for the `timeLimit` variable in `js/app.js`

## TODO
add 3 user selectable levels:
easy (2 min.), normal (1.5 min.), hard (30 sec)
